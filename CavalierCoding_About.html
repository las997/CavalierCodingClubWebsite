	<h4> What is Cavalier Coding?</h4>
	<p>
		Founded in January of 2014 by students Jack Taylor and Lauren Suna, Cavalier Coding is a club at <a href="http://www.harveyschool.org">The Harvey School</a>. Cavalier Coding's primary objective is to teach students how to code through hands-on projects, which each have a simple theme. While learning how to code is held as a priority by Cavalier Coding, the club also teaches lessons in teamwork, recponsibilty, and competition. One could also say that Cavalier Coding's main focus is having fun, but that does not feel neccesary to point, because the fact that the group is coding implies having fun.

	<h4> Why Coding? </h4>
	<p>
		Learning has always been fundemental to maintaining a civil society, and there are many subjects to learn about. So why do the members of Cavalier COding choose to learn about Coding? Well, aside from it being an eternally incomplete puzzle that provides endless entertainment, the ability to code is  becoming one of the most important skills a person can have. Every day, American consumers decide that they need to purchase a product. To do so, over 70% of these consumers start with a <a href="https://www.google.com"> Google</a> search. As well as this, Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project has <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/06/cell-phone-ownership-hits-91-of-adults/">found</a> that more than 90% of American adults have cell phones. Moreover, to read this paragraph, you're using the internet! The reason that so many people are able to use the aformentioned services, and many more, is because of coding. Therefore, the best way to capitalize off of America's use of coding is by beomcing a coder. Many companies know that coders are important as well. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.html">estimated</a> that there are currently 1,018,000 jobs in software developement, with an increase of 22% over the next ten years! With all of these impressive statistics, coding is clearly an important skill.

	<h4> How Can You Get Involved? </h4>
	<p>
		After reading so many amazing things about coding, you're probably wondering how you can get involved with coding. Well, if you are a harvey student, it is quite simple; you can simply join either a class or Cavalier Coding. If you are not a Harvey student, then you can either find a class, or utilize one of the many resources this site has listed under "resources."
